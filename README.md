# Breakout-Atari

This project uses the Breakout environment from the **Gym library** and trains an agent to play the game successfully.

The agent is penalized for losing the ball (and consequently life) and receives positive rewards for hitting bricks.

The algorithm enabling the agent to learn is **Dueling Double Deep Q-Learning**.
